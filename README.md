# Test 2 API
 
This project contains a JSON file which contains a collection of API calls.

Each API Calls has a number of associated tests under the 'tests' tab.

The tests for the API's can be ran individually by importing the JSON file which contains the collection to your workspace via Postman. You will then need to go into the 'ReqRes' collection, click the 'tests' tab and then send the API to trigger the test.

The tests can also be ran all together by clicking on the 3 dots to the right of the 'ReqRes' collection, and then clicking 'Run collection'. You will then see some options appear about which tests you want to run as well as the iterations and some other information. You will see the 'Run ReqRes' button on the far right and once clicked, will trigger all the tests to run one after the other.
